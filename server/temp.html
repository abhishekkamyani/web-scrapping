                    <p>Adobe Experience Platform is a suite of customer experience management (<a
                            href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/customer-experience-management-CEM-or-CXM">CXM</a>)
                        solutions from Adobe. Organizations can use the platform to centralize customer data and to
                        design and deliver rich, personalized CX.</p>
                    <p>Experience Platform is a powerful, flexible open system for building customized CX with the help
                        of data science and <a
                            href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/machine-learning-ML">machine
                            learning</a>. It includes numerous real-time personalization and user interaction tools to
                        create highly individualized digital experiences for customers. In addition, it provides
                        organizations with a 360-degree view of their customers and those customers' preferences, and
                        then use this data to design richer CX.</p>
                    <p>Organizations that have invested in Adobe Experience Cloud applications such as Marketing Cloud,
                        Analytics Cloud, Advertising Cloud or Commerce Cloud can use Experience Platform to bring
                        together customer data from all these applications -- and other non-Adobe applications -- and
                        use it for CX design and delivery.</p>
                    <p>The platform is built on <a

                            APIs</a> and can be easily integrated with other tools and applications. Adobe has built
                        multiple applications and services on top of Adobe Experience Platform, including its Real-Time
                        Customer Data Platform (RTCDP), <a

                        Platform</h2>
                    <p>Multiple elements work together to form a cohesive architecture for Adobe Experience Platform.
                        Data sources comprise the primary element of Experience Platform's architecture, and the
                        platform can ingest data from many sources, including the following:</p>
                    <ul class="default-list">
                        <li><a
                                href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/CRM-customer-relationship-management">CRM</a>
                            platforms.</li>
                        <li><a
                                href="https://www.techtarget.com/searcherp/definition/ERP-enterprise-resource-planning">ERP</a>
                            platforms.</li>
                        <li>Sales and marketing tools.</li>
                        <li>Enterprise <a
                                href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatamanagement/definition/data-lake">data
                                lakes</a>.</li>
                        <li>Customer insight tools.</li>
                        <li>Machine learning models.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Adobe Experience Platform can ingest data from any of these sources via streaming or a batch API.
                        Adobe also provides connectors that directly ingest data into the platform from many data
                        sources -- such as extract, transform and load tools -- as well as other Adobe applications.</p>
                    <p>Once the platform ingests data, that data gets placed in its raw form into the platform's data
                        lake. Adobe Experience Platform features access controls to data and capabilities for specific
                        users and data governance controls to ensure that data is properly used. An extensible
                        "experience data model" provides a common <a
                            href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcontentmanagement/definition/taxonomy">taxonomy</a>
                        for any data stored in the platform, enabling detailed data analyses and the creation of more
                        unified profiles.</p>
                    <p>Other important elements of the platform include query services, a data science workspace and
                        intelligent services. Query services enable administrators to run SQL queries on the raw data in
                        the platform and enable external applications such as <a
                            href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcontentmanagement/definition/Microsoft-Power-BI">Power
                            BI</a> to access data in the data lake. The workspace creates a space for data scientists to
                        build models using the data in the lake. Intelligent services such as attribution AI are
                        prebuilt models that help accelerate model-building and generate useful and actionable customer
                        insights. The platform's Segment Builder operates against real-time customer profiles and
                        enables organizations to do things like build user populations.</p>
                    <p>The Experience Platform also includes applications for business users such as marketers. These
                        business user applications -- including CJA, RTCDP and Journey Orchestration -- sit on top of
                        the platform. It can also be integrated with additional third-party customer and partner
                        applications via APIs.</p>

                    <p>The platform provides several features that help with administration and oversight to improve

                        or when errors occur, which reduces the requirement of polling the Observability Insights API.
                        Alert messages can be sent once, or they can repeat for a predetermined time interval until the
                        alert is resolved.</p>
                    <p>The experience platform provides two channels to manage alerts: Adobe I/O Events and Platform UI.
                        However, an administrator must enable several access controls permissions through the Adobe
                        Admin Console in order to work with the Platform UI. These permissions include View Alerts, View
                        Alerts History, Manage Alerts and Resolve Alerts.</p>
                    <p>The Adobe Experience Platform provides <a

                        sandbox represents a virtual environment for both development and production purposes. It
                        maintains its own independent library of Platform resources, such as schemas, datasets and
                        profiles. Production sandboxes can be used with profiles in the production environment, while
                        development sandboxes can be used for development and testing with non-production profiles.</p>

                        Experience Platform</h2>
                    <p>Adobe Experience Platform integrates with many Adobe Experience Cloud applications and
                        application services. For example, its two-way integration with Analytics Cloud ensures that
                        data collected via the Web/Mobile SDK can be forwarded to Adobe Analytics and data collected by
                        Analytics Cloud can be sent to the platform data lake and profile store.</p>
                    <p>The platform also integrates with Adobe Audience Manager so that audiences defined in the RTCDP
                        can be shared with Audience Manager for activation in third-party cookie destinations.
                        Similarly, integrations with Campaign Classic and Campaign Standard enable audiences defined in
                        RTCDP to be shared with each relevant application in order to initiate campaigns.</p>
                    <p>Some other important integrations of Experience Platform include the following:</p>
                    <ul class="default-list">
                        <li>Experience Manager, which powers personalized CX through the Target integration.</li>
                        <li>Journey Optimizer, which initiates and powers customer journeys to build audiences.</li>
                        <li>Adobe Commerce, which personalizes audiences and profiles built in RTCDP.</li>
                        <li>Marketo Engage, which shares audiences defined in RTCDP to initiate campaigns.</li>
                        <li>Target, which shares audiences and profile attributes from RTCDP for the purpose of
                            personalizing and targeting experiences.</li>
                    </ul>
